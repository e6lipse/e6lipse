# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

My name is Nazar Kolomiets. Iâ€™m currently learning, working my skills in web development.
In the future, I want to become a full stack developer, but at the moment I'm fixated on the frontend.
## :man_technologist: About me
    
I am an ordinary guy from Kyiv who is keen on programming and creating something new. 
I am far from the best in this business. But I am very stubborn and assiduous.
